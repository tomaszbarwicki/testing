# Introduction and Goals

Supply networks are complex. Supply or demand shortages affect multiple partners along the
supply network. In case a shortage occurs, partners need to collect and exchange manually
while discussing the potential actions to take.

PURIS FOSS tries to address this manual collection of data. The application tries to facilitate
this information exchange by implementing the respective information exchange.

PURIS FOSS tries to solve short-term information needs within a given business relationship.
The information are production and supply chain related. The full-fledged vision is a dashboard
allowing partners to make their situation transparent exchanging production-related demands,
planned production quantities and stocks. This information is visualized and exchanged
on a day granularity and shall be enhanced by delivery information.

In case of material shortages, commonly manual work is done. This tool shall allow to exchange
common information in those cases and allow status evaluation to not even run into shortages.

Based on less manual work needed, if the system is integrated, users may exchange and collect
information much faster so that the employees focus on the actual resolving.
Additionally, PURIS FOSS in Catena-X follows International Data Spaces (IDS) and GAIA-X principles
providing data sovereignty.

## Requirements Overview

The following requirements shall be fulfilled:
- Exchange material flow related data (demand, production outputs, stocks and delivery information)
- Visualize the exchanged information.
